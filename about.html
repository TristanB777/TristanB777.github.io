    <p>Hi I'm tristan I made this website for class and yet had problems with it. and I went to york to for two reasons, I'm really interested by IT and have been practically my whole life. yet I was always bullied and nobody ever did anything no matter what I told them so I decied to go to York tech because of it. and It's been a lot better I still have some problems but at least they're ones I can fix myself and Do on my own and im proud of myself for my accomplishments. I'm trying my best to keep pushing myself further but I'm not perfect and Feedback is helpful so I'm not gonna stop pushing till the day I fall. so if you have any feedback tell me at TherealtristanB@Gmail.com as I said It's extremlly useful and sorry for any typos.</p>
