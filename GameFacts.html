    <p>I don't know if my game is even beatable unless you do some serrious grinding. and yet I had fun making it yes their is most likey a lot of bugs
       I haven't noticed but I enjoyed working on it. and that should be way you make games passion not money. You should enjoy watching your community. 
       what they do because they like your game. so if you aren't having fun with making something then. have a seprate one for stuff that you enjoy for
